### Algebra

- **Definition**: Algebra is arithmetic that includes non-numerical entities like \(x\).
- **Example**: \(2x + 5 = 25\)

### Linear Algebra

**Definition**: Linear algebra is the study of vectors and matrices and the operations that can be performed on them. There are only three options in linear algebra: one, no, or infinite solutions.

### History and Key Concepts

**Tensors**:
- **Definition**: Tensors are multidimensional arrays that generalize scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions.
- **Applications**: Used to represent data with complex structures and perform operations in fields like physics, engineering, and computer science, especially in machine learning and deep learning.

**Scalars**:
- **Definition**: A scalar is a single number that represents magnitude but has no direction.
- **Applications**: Used to measure quantities like temperature, mass, and speed.
- **Practice**: Creation exercises

**Vectors**:
- **Definition**: A vector is a one-dimentional array of numbers.vector represent a magnitude and direction from origin
- **Practice**: Creation exercises
- **Other Concepts**:
  - Vector transposition:  switching the vector's columns and rows
  - Norms: function that measures the size of a vector, matrix or tesor. It's a way to quantify the magnitude of vector
    - L1 Norm: also known as the Euclidean norm, is a way to measure the distance between a vector and the origin
    - L2 Norm: the sum of absolute norm of all the components of a vector.It's also know as Manhattan norm or the Taxicab norm, squared L2 norm equals simply x^Tx
    - Max Norm: also known as the "Lâˆž norm", is a mathematical concept that measures the "size" of a vector by taking the absolute value of its largest component
  - Unit vector: A vector that has magnitude of 1 is a unit vector 
  - Orthogonal vectors
  - Orthonormal vectors
  - Arrays in NumPy

**Matrices**:
- **Definition**: A matrix is a 2D array of numbers.

**Tensors in Programming**:
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow and PyTorch
