### Algebra

- **Definition**: Algebra is arithmetic that includes non-numerical entities like \(x\).
- **Example**: \(2x + 5 = 25\)

### Linear Algebra

**Definition**: Linear algebra is the study of vectors and matrices and the operations that can be performed on them. There are only three options in linear algebra: one, no, or infinite solutions.

### History and Key Concepts

**Tensors**:
- **Definition**: Tensors are multidimensional arrays that generalize scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions.
- **Applications**: Used to represent data with complex structures and perform operations in fields like physics, engineering, and computer science, especially in machine learning and deep learning.

**Scalars**:
- **Definition**: A scalar is a single number that represents magnitude but has no direction.
- **Applications**: Used to measure quantities like temperature, mass, and speed.
- **Practice**: Creation exercises

**Vectors**:
- **Definition**: A vector is a one-dimentional array of numbers.vector represent a magnitude and direction from origin
- **Practice**: Creation exercises
- **Other Concepts**:
  - Vector transposition:  switching the vector's columns and rows
  - norms: functions that quantify vector magnitude
  - unit vectors
  - orthogonal vectors
  - orthonormal vectors
  - arrays in NumPy

**Matrices**:
- **Definition**: A matrix is a 2D array of numbers.

**Tensors in Programming**:
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow and PyTorch
