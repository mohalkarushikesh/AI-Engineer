### Algebra

- **Definition**: Algebra is arithmetic that includes non-numerical entities like \(x\).
- **Example**: \(2x + 5 = 25\)

### Linear Algebra

**Definition**: Linear algebra is the study of vectors and matrices and the operations that can be performed on them. There are only three options in linear algebra: one, no, or infinite solutions.

### History and Key Concepts

**Tensors**:
- **Definition**: Tensors are **multidimensional arrays** that generalize scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions.
- **Applications**: Used to represent data with complex structures and perform operations in fields like physics, engineering, and computer science, especially in machine learning and deep learning.

**Scalars**:
- **Definition**: A scalar is a single number that represents magnitude but has no direction.
- **Applications**: Used to measure quantities like temperature, mass, and speed.
- **Practice**: Creation exercises

**Vectors**:
- **Definition**: A vector is a one-dimentional array of numbers.vector represent a magnitude and direction from origin
- **Practice**: Creation exercises
- **Other Concepts**:
  - Vector transposition:  switching the vector's columns and rows
  - Norms: function that measures the size of a vector, matrix or tesor. It's a way to quantify the magnitude of vector
    - L1 Norm: also known as the Euclidean norm, is a way to measure the distance between a vector and the origin
    - L2 Norm: the sum of absolute norm of all the components of a vector.It's also know as Manhattan norm or the Taxicab norm, squared L2 norm equals simply x^Tx
    - Max Norm: also known as the "Lâˆž norm", is a mathematical concept that measures the "size" of a vector by taking the absolute value of its largest component
  - Unit vector: A vector that has magnitude of 1 is a unit vector
  - Basis vector: can be scaled to represent any vector in a given vector space (typically use unit vectors alog axes of vector space)
  - Orthogonal vectors: x and y are orthogonal vectors if xTy=0 (are at 90 degree angle to each other)
  - Orthonormal vectors: are orthogonal vectors and all have unit norm (ex: basis vector)
  - Arrays in NumPy

**Matrices/Matrix**:
- **Definition**: A matrix is a Two-dimentional array of numbers.
- denoted uppercase, italics, bold ex: X
- height is given priority ahead of width in notation i.e: (Nrow, Ncol)

**Tensors in Programming**:
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Generic Tensor notation: uppercase, bold, italics, sans sherf e.g. X

### Contemporary Applications

- **Solving for Unknowns**: In machine learning algorithms, including deep learning
- **Reducing Dimensionality**: E.g., Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Ranking Results**: E.g., Eigenvector
- **Recommenders**: E.g., Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- **Natural Language Processing**:
  - Topic modeling
  - Semantic analysis
