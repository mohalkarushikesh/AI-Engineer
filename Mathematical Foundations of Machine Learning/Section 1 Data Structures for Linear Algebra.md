  - What is algebra is
      Algebra is aithmetic that includes non-numerical entities like X ex: 2x+5=25
  
  Linear Algebra: Solving for unknowns within system of linear equations
    There are only three options in linear algebra : one, no, or infinite solutions.

    Tensors: Tensors : ML genralization of vector and matrices to any no of dimentions (3D, ND)
    Scalars: 0D
    vectors: 1D
    vector transposition
    norms and unit vectors

  contempory applications
  - solving for unknowns in ML algos, including deep learning
  - Reducing dimentionality (e.g principal component analysis)
  - Ranking results (e.g with eigen vector)
  - Recommenders (e.g singular value decomposition, SVD)
  - Natural language processing (eg SVD, matrix factorization)
    - Topic modeling
    - semantic analysis
